SHELL:  Open Kernel 2 Manual

DESCRIPTION
  The shell API is one of the few Open Kernel standard APIs exposed in the global environment (_G). It provides several utility
  functions that can be used in shell commands, accessible under _G.shell.

FUNCTIONS
  The shell API provides the following utility functions.

  shell.resolve(path: string): string
    Resolve the provided path to an absolute location in your filesystem.

  shell.getWorkingDirectory(): string
    Get the current working directory. Alias for os.getenv("PWD").

  shell.setWorkingDirectory(newDirectory: string)
    Set the current working directory. This is a checked version of os.setenv("PWD", newDirectory).

  shell.parse(...): arguments: table, options: table
    Parse the provided arguments into arguments and options. shell.parse supports both short (i.e. -dog) and long (i.e. --dog) options.
    Long options may have values assigned to them with the syntax --option=thisWillShowUpAsAString.
    The options table's keys are option names (with the - or -- truncated) and its values either true or the specified custom value.

  shell.execute(command, ...)
    Execute command `command` from the shell's path, optionally with arguments.
