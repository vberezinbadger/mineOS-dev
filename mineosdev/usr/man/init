INIT:  Open Kernel 2 Manual

DESCRIPTION
  The init script takes care of system initialization once multitasking has been initialized by the kernel. A custom init script may
  be specified with the 'init' kernel flag.

  The default Open Kernel 2 init script (OpenRC) is located at /sbin/init.lua. The kernel passes it the maximum system runlevel,
  specified through kernel flag 'runlevel', which if nil is set to 3. (Only runlevels 1 and 2 are used.)

  When loaded, OpenRC loads its configuration from /etc/inittab. If the configuration fails to load, OpenRC will error and the
  system will panic. This configuration specifies startup scripts and services, as well as the order to start them in.

CONFIGURATION
  OpenRC configuration is stored at /etc/inittab in a serialized Lua table. Startup scripts are specified in the sub-section
  'startup', and background services in 'daemons'.
  
  Each configuration entry is a table with at least two fields, 'id' and 'file'. 'id' specifies the name of the task, and 'file' is
  the absolute path to the script.
