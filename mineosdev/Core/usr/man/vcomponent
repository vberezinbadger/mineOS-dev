VCOMPONENT:  Open Kernel 2 Manual

DESCRIPTION
  vcomponent is a kernel-level API, allowing for easy connectivity of virtual components.

FUNCTIONS
  vcomponent does not have a dedicated API, but rather wraps the existing component API, adding two new functions.
  
  component.create(component: table)
    Add a new virtual component. When component.proxy is called, this table will be returned. The component type and address are
    specified in this table, just as they would be in a standard component proxy.
    Queues a component_added event when called.
  
  component.remove(address: string)
    Remove the virtual component with the specified address. Queues a component_removed event.
