DEVFS:  Open Kernel 2 Manual

DESCRIPTION
  Open Kernel 2 ships with a primitive device FS. It does not support directories, and as of March 8 2020 is mostly only good for
  retrieving addresses of components, useful in mounting filesystems. The devfs is automatically mounted at boot, and helper
  functions can be accessed through the devfs API.

FUNCTIONS
  The following helper functions are present.
  
  devfs.getAddress(devicePath: string): string
    Returns the component address of the specified device.

  devfs.poke(device: string, method: string[, ...])
    Similar to component.invoke, except operating on a virtual device.
