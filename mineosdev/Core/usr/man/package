PACKAGE:  Open Kernel 2 Manulal

DESCRIPTION
  The package API is one of the few Open Kernel APIs exposed in the global environment (_G). It contains a subset of standards-
  compliant functions and variables, matching those of the Lua standard library.

FUNCTIONS
  The following functions are available in the package API.

  package.searchpath(module: string[, path: string[, separator: string[, repeat: number]]]): string or false, string error
    Search the package path for the specified module. Returns the full filepath on success, or false and an error message on
    failure.

  package also provides require() and dofile().

  dofile(filepath: string): ...
    Loads and executes a file from the provided path. Returns the file's return values on success, or false and an error message on
    failure.

  require(module: string):  ... or boolean, string or nil
    Wrapper around dofile, loading from the package searchpath. Returns the module's return values on success, or false and an error
    message on failure.

VARIABLES
  The following variables and tables are in the package API.

  package.loaded: table
    A cache of all previously loaded APIs. Reset on computer shutdown.

    The table's keys are module names, and its values their return values.

  package.path: string
    The path which package.searchpath() and require() use to search for modules. Paths are formatted as "/usr/lib/?.lua", where all
    instances of the '?' character will be replaced with the module name.
